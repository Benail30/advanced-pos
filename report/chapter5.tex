\chapter{Sprint 3 – POS Interface \& Invoicing}

\section{Introduction}

The third sprint focused on developing the core cashier interface and implementing the complete invoicing system. While Sprint 2 established the administrative foundation for user and product management, Sprint 3 addressed the primary user-facing functionality: the point-of-sale interface that cashiers use for daily operations and the comprehensive invoicing system that completes transactions.

This sprint was crucial for delivering the core business value of the POS system, as it enables cashiers to efficiently process sales, manage customer transactions, and generate proper invoices for all purchases.
