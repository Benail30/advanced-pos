This end-of-studies project was conducted as part of the curriculum for the \textbf{Licence degree in Business Intelligence} at the \textbf{Higher Institute of Management of Sousse (ISGS)}, University of Sousse, Tunisia. The internship was carried out remotely in collaboration with \textbf{Synthron Lab}, a Tunisian software development company specializing in modern web applications and data-driven solutions.

The project focuses on the design and development of a full-featured Point of Sale web application enhanced with real-time business intelligence dashboards using Microsoft Power BI. The main objectives include developing a responsive web-based POS system with secure role-based authentication, comprehensive administrative tools for user and product management, an intuitive cashier interface for sales processing, automated invoice generation with QR codes, and embedded Power BI dashboards for business analytics.

This report documents the complete development process following an agile Scrum methodology across four main sprints: authentication and role management, administrative interface development, POS interface and invoicing system implementation, and business intelligence integration. Each chapter presents the technical implementation, testing results, and lessons learned during the software development lifecycle.
