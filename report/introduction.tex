In a rapidly evolving digital world, businesses increasingly rely on intelligent and integrated systems to optimize operations and support strategic decision-making. Point of Sale (POS) systems, in particular, have become essential tools across the retail and service industries. Beyond facilitating transactions, modern POS platforms serve as comprehensive management hubs—handling inventory tracking, user roles, payment workflows, and customer insights.

This end-of-studies project was conducted as part of the curriculum at the Institut Supérieur de Gestion de Sousse (ISGS). It focuses on the design and development of a full-featured POS web application enhanced with real-time business intelligence dashboards using Power BI. The goal was to build a user-friendly yet powerful platform capable of managing sales, tracking inventory, and analyzing performance in a flexible and efficient manner.

The report outlines each phase of the software development lifecycle—from requirements gathering and functional analysis to system design, implementation, and deployment in a development environment. It also highlights the technological choices, development methodology, encountered challenges, and lessons learned during the internship.
