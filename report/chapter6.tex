\chapter{Sprint 4 – Business Intelligence and Finalization}

\section{Introduction}

In the final sprint, the focus moved from operational functionality to strategic visibility. The goal was to provide administrators with a visual interface to monitor performance, track sales trends, and make data-informed decisions. This was achieved by integrating dashboards built using Microsoft Power BI directly into the application.

Additionally, this sprint included final UI polishing, user experience refinements, and manual system-wide testing to ensure the platform was production-ready.

\section{Business Intelligence Goals}

The integration of BI dashboards aimed to:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Monitor product performance (top sellers, low stock).
  \item Track total revenue and payment breakdowns.
  \item Provide per-cashier activity summaries.
  \item Enable real-time visibility for business stakeholders.
\end{itemize}

Power BI was selected due to its cloud accessibility, ease of integration, and robust data visualization features.

The project followed a structured 4-sprint approach with the following outcomes:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Sprint 1:} Authentication and role management - Completed successfully
  \item \textbf{Sprint 2:} User and product management (Admin) - Delivered on schedule
  \item \textbf{Sprint 3:} POS interface and invoicing - Implemented with full functionality
  \item \textbf{Sprint 4:} Business intelligence integration - Completed with Power BI dashboards
\end{itemize}

Each sprint delivered working software increments, allowing for continuous testing and validation throughout the development process.

\section{Conclusion}

Sprint 4 marked the final phase of the POS system development. By embedding Power BI, the application now supports not only operational flows but also decision-making. The platform is fully functional, visually consistent, and aligned with the project objectives.
